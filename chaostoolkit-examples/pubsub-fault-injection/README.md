# Overview

This documentation illustrates the steps involved in executing an end to end proof of concept to demonstrate the ability to introduce faults in resources from a VPC like compute instances can access the gcp services like Pub/Sub through private google access , primarily leveraging the Chaos Toolkit framework and its GCP extension. It has two components, application, and chaos experiment.

# PreRequisites
1. Make sure that you have Google CLI and Terraform installed.
2. Login to GCP project using `gcloud auth login` on the terminal to execute terraform resources and set the project.
3. Clone the repository to your system and cd into `chaostoolkit-examples/pubsub-fault-injection/scripts` directory.
4. The GCP user to run the experiment should have the permissions to impersonate the terraform service account used to create the resources and to access the compute vm.
```
    Service Account Token Creator
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Admin
    IAP-secured Tunnel User
```
5. create a GCS Bucket for Terraform Backend for the project, the name need to be `${project-Id}-terraform-backend`. For example, if the project id you work on is `chaos-test-project-410715`, then the bucket name should be `chaos-test-project-410715-terraform-backend` Please also create local folder for terraform to generate some helper scripts.
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chaostoolkit-examples/
sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/chaostoolkit-examples
```
6. Make sure `Cloud Resource Manager API`, `Service Usage API` are enabled. Run the following command

Steps : 
This recipe can be run by following these steps, `cd chaostoolkit-examples/pubsub-fault-injection/scripts`.

1. Initiate the environment, `./1-init.sh`

2. Provision the application and chaos experiement,`./2-provision.sh`.
Note : Wait for approx 5 mins before running experiement , ( reason : vm might be busy in booting up and installing the required packages ) 
3. Experiment Execution, `./3-4-ssh_to_client.sh` to ssh to the client VM, then run `./run.sh`, or you can just run `./3-5-remote_run.sh`

4. Cleanup, `./9-cleanup.sh`

That's it. Let us dive in.

## The Steady State Application

The following diagram illustrates an applicaiton subscribing to pub/sub topics.

# Choas Experiment:  

This experiment demonstrates how faults can introduced in the compute instance network tag and firewall not allowing the traffic from private google access IPs. The steady state is application responding 200 from server and when network tag is changed applying firewall, it responds with a 500. The following is the architecture diagram for the chaos experiment.

Manual Steps ( if not following above mentioned steps)
1. Make sure that you have Google CLI and Terraform installed.
2. The GCP user to run the experiment should have the permissions to impersonate the terraform service account used to create the resources.
```
    Service Account Token Creator
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Admin
    IAP-secured Tunnel User

```

3. The following IAM permissions are required on the terraform service account to create the GCP infra resources required for this experiment, run [createSA.sh](scripts/createSA.sh) once to create them. If new roles are identifed for the SA, please modify the scripts and run it again.
    
```
    Compute Admin 
    Compute Network Admin
    PubSub Admin
    DNS Administrator
    Monitoring Editor 
    Service Usage Consumer
    Create Service Account
    Delete Service Account
    Service Account User
    Service Account token creator
    Service Account Key Admin
```
4. If it doesn't exist, please create a GCS Bucket for Terraform Backend for the project, the name need to be `${project-Id}-terraform-backend`. For example, if the project id you work on is `chaos-test-project-410715`, then the bucket name should be `chaos-test-project-410715-terraform-backend` Please also create local folder for terraform to generate some helper scripts.
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chaostoolkit-examples/
sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/chaostoolkit-examples
```

## Experiment Execution
1. Login to GCP project using `gcloud auth login` on the terminal to execute terraform resources and set the project.
2. Clone the repository to your system and cd into `chaostoolkit-examples/pubsub-cloudrun-fault-injection/app/scripts` directory.
3. For deploying new infrastructure only, you may optionally update the `terraform.tfvars` file with the appropriate values. For information regarding the resources created by terraform and the variables required, pls check [Terraform README.md](terraform/README.md)
4. In case pre-existing testing infrastructure exists, skip to step 6.
5. Run [setupApp.sh](app/scripts/setupApp.sh) to create this service account. Then cd into `terraform` folder and run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform, `terraform validate` to validate the configuration, `terraform plan` to visualize the components that will be created, and `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure on the set project. Your testing infrastructure should now be ready. Please make a note of the project_id, server_IP and client_IP created for running the experiment from terraform output. Terraform will create a [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete?_ga=2.31241532.-2014251715.1702981216) for the service account created by terraform. This will be used for running the experiment. Incase the Infra is pre-existing, please use a service account with the following IAM roles:
```
       "roles/compute.admin" \
       "roles/compute.networkAdmin" \
       "roles/pubsub.admin" \
       "roles/pubsub.editor" \
       "roles/dns.admin" \
       "roles/dns.reader" \
       "roles/monitoring.editor" \
       "roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin" \
       "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin" \
       "roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin" \
       "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser" \
       "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" \
       "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
```
    
The following are all the commands in the item 5.
    
```
    (~) $ cd app/scripts
    (scripts) $ ./setupApp.sh
    (scripts) $ cd ../terraform
    (terraform) $ terraform init
    (terraform) $ terraform plan
    (terraform) $ terraform apply
```

The applicaiton will be created after `terraform apply`.  The following files under `/tmp/pubsub-fault-injection` will be generated by `terraform/template.tf`.


On the server VM, it will bootstrap a Python Flask Server:
----------------------------

Server startup scripti template[server-startup.tf](app/terraform/server-startup.tf) will be used to created a startup script for the server and install the packages needed for running python file and create 2 files on the server VM.

| File                | Description|
| ----                | -----------|
|`flask_server.py`    |This python file has the code for publishing messages from a file to pubsub using python sdk client to a topic "hellopsc", the topic is being created as a part of terraform |
|`messages_server.txt`|This text file has the message that needs to be published to the pubsub|

As the last step in the startup script, it will run `python3 flask_server.py <gcp_project_id>` where `<gcp_project_id>` will be substitued with the current GCP Project Id. Please check the logs before proceeding to the next step. 

```
    (scripts) $ ./check_server_log.sh

```

This indicates that the client completed installing chaos toolkit and dependencies. You can proceed to the next steps:

6. You can run `./3-5-remote_run.sh` to run experiment. Alternatively, you can use `./3-4-ssh_to_client.sh` to SSH to client machine. When you are in the shell of client machine, you can run the folowing experiment,

```
    (~) $ ./run.sh   #for experiment
```

This command will execute `chaos run experiment.json --var-file=variables.env`. Expect the following output:

```

If you see the following error, please run `./3-1-check_client_log.sh` to make sure the VM bootstrap script is complete. 
```
./run.sh: line 1: /var/.venvs/chaostk/bin/activate: No such file or directory
./run.sh: line 2: chaos: command not found
```

## CleanUp
1. Cleanup of the experiment is included in the `experiments.json` file and runs automatically once the experiment is complete.
2. In case any infrastructure was deployed for the testing only, run `terraform destroy` to delete the test infrastructure. Make sure that the only state file in the directory is of the test infrastructure, otherwise any other Terraform infrastructure could also be deleted accidentally.

You can run this script, `./cleanup.sh`
