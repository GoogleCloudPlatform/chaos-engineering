# PreRequisites
1. Make sure that you have Google CLI and Terraform installed.
2. Login to GCP project using `gcloud auth login` on the terminal to execute terraform resources and set the project.
3. Clone the repository to your system and cd into `chaostoolkit-examples/l7ilb-urlmap-fault-injection/scripts` directory.
4. The GCP user to run the experiment should have the permissions to impersonate the terraform service account used to create the resources and to access the compute vm.
```
    Service Account Token Creator
    Service Account User
    Service Uasge Admin
    IAP-secured Tunnel User
    App Hub Admin
```
5. create a GCS Bucket for Terraform Backend for the project, the name need to be `${project-Id}-terraform-backend`. For example, if the project id you work on is `chaos-test-project-410715`, then the bucket name should be `chaos-test-project-410715-terraform-backend` Please also create local folder for terraform to generate some helper scripts.
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chaostoolkit-examples/
sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/chaostoolkit-examples
```
6. Make sure `Cloud Resource Manager API`, `Service Usage API` are enabled. Run the following command

Steps : 
This recipe can be run by following these steps, `cd chaostoolkit-examples/l7ilb-urlmap-fault-injection/scripts`.

1. Initiate the environment, `./1-init.sh`

2. Provision the application and chaos experiement,`./2-provision.sh`.
Note : Wait for approx 5 mins before running experiement , ( reason : vm might be busy in booting up and installing the required packages ) 

3. Run Below Gcloud Commands to create/attach Apphub related resource :

In below commands change your project name same as where you are running the experiment .


```
gcloud alpha apphub service-projects add ashish-ctk-test-project \
    --project=ashish-ctk-test-project

gcloud alpha apphub applications create myapphub-app1 \
  --display-name='myapphub-app1 for fault injection' \
  --scope-type=REGIONAL \
  --project=ashish-ctk-test-project \
  --location=us-central1


gcloud alpha apphub discovered-services list \
  --filter='service_properties.gcp_project=projects/ashish-ctk-test-project' \
  --project=ashish-ctk-test-project \
  --location=us-central1
```
(copy manually) 
** copy the service id of backendServices/l7-ilb-backend-subnet-apphub from output of above command :
ID: c3040a77-d798-48b8-acf0-4a862d6b87be
and use in below command

```
gcloud apphub applications services create l7-ilb-backend-subnet-apphub-service1 --application=myapphub-app1 --location=us-central1  --discovered-service='projects/ashish-ctk-test-project/locations/us-central1/discoveredServices/c3040a77-d798-48b8-acf0-4a862d6b87be' --display-name='l7-ilb-backend-subnet-apphub-service1' --project=ashish-ctk-test-project 
```

4. Experiment Execution, `./3-4-ssh_to_client.sh` to ssh to the client VM, then run `./run.sh`, or you can just run `./3-5-remote_run.sh`

5. Manualy cleanup the Resources which were created in step 3.

6. Cleanup, `./9-cleanup.sh`

That's it. Let us dive in.

## The Steady State Application

The following diagram illustrates an applicaiton using load balancer, and managed instance groups.

# Manual Steps ( if not following above mentioned steps)
1. Make sure that you have Google CLI and Terraform installed.
2. Login to GCP project using `gcloud auth login` on the terminal to execute terraform resources and set the project.
3. Clone the repository to your system and cd into `chaostoolkit-examples/l7ilb-urlmap-fault-injection/app/scripts` directory.
4. The GCP user to run the experiment should have the permissions to impersonate the terraform service account used to create the resources and to access the compute vm.
```
    Service Account Token Creator
    Service Account User
    Service Uasge Admin
    IAP-secured Tunnel User
    App Hub Admin
```
5. The following IAM permissions are required on the terraform service account to create the GCP infra resources required for this experiment, , run [createSA.sh](scripts/createSA.sh) once to create them. If new roles are identifed for the SA, please modify the scripts and run it again.

    ```
    Compute Admin
    Create Service Accounts
    Delete service accounts
    Project IAM Admin
    Service Account Token Creator
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Admin
    Viewer
    ```
6. If it doesn't exist, please create a GCS Bucket for Terraform Backend for the project, the name need to be `${project-Id}-terraform-backend`. For example, if the project id you work on is `chaos-test-project-410715`, then the bucket name should be `chaos-test-project-410715-terraform-backend` Please also create local folder for terraform to generate some helper scripts.
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/chaostoolkit-examples/
sudo chmod -R 777 /opt/chaostoolkit-examples
```

7. Make sure `Cloud Resource Manager API`, `Service Usage API` are enabled. Run the following command
   ```
   ./setupApp.sh
   ```
   The service account for terraform will be created for you, and create `terrraform/terraform.tfvars` with default values.
8. You can still update the `terrform.tfvars` file with the appropriate values. For information regarding the resources created by terraform and the variables required, please check [Terraform README.md](./terraform/README.md)
9. Run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform, `terraform validate` to validate the configuration, `terraform plan` to visualize the components that will be created.  run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure on the set project. Your testing infrastructure should now be ready. Please note the Service Account created for running the experiment from terraform output. Terraform code will [Create a service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) in a local file `../chaos-experiment-config/serviceaccount.json` for the service account created by terraform. This will be used for running the experiment. In case the Infra is pre-existing, please use a service account with `roles/compute.networkViewer` and `roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin` permissions for this purpose. 


10. cd into `chaostoolkit-examples/l7ilb-urlmap-fault-injection/chaos-experiment/scripts` directory. Run the following command
```
    ./setupChaos.sh
```
Terraform will generate linux scrpts and copy all the files under `../choas-experiment-config` to the client VM.


the following files will be generated under `$folder` folder, as defined in `scripts/.setEnv.sh`

| File                  | Description |
| ----                  | ----------- |
|`check_client_log.sh`  | Shell script to ssh to the client vm and do `tail -f /var/log/syslog` on that VM|
|`copy_to_client.sh`    | Shell script to SCP all the file under `../chaos-experiment-config` to client VM|
|`remote_run.sh`        | Shell script to SSH to client VM and run the experiment|
|`ssh_to_client.sh`     | Shell script to SSH to client VM|


Scripts under this  directory can be used to call those generated scripts

```

# CleanUp
1. Cleanup of the experiment is included in the experiments.json file and runs automatically once the experiment is complete.
2. Manualy cleanup the Resources which were created in step 3.
3. In case any infrastructure was deployed for the testing only, run `terraform destroy` to delete the test infrastructure. Make sure that the only state file in the directory is of the test infrastructure, otherwise any other Terraform infrastructure could also be deleted accidentally.

You can run this script, `./9-cleanup.sh` to clean up the resoureces used by this experiement.
